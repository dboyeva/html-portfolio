<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi, I'm Dash!
</p>

<p>
  Welcome to my corner of the web. I'm passionate about creating beautiful websites, exploring yoga philosophy, and connecting with nature. My journey began in product management and design, working in industries like gaming and real estate. Over the years, I've shifted my focus toward wellness, creativity, and building meaningful experiences through yoga and technology
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not working on web development projects or leading yoga classes, you'll find me experimenting in the garden, hiking in the countryside, or brainstorming ideas for sustainable living. I dream of creating a life that combines my love for wellness, nature, and communityâ€”whether that's through yoga, growing my own food, or building a more self-sufficient lifestyle.
